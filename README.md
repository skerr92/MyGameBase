# MyGameBase
A Base code for games built in Java.

# Welcome!

Thanks for checking out this open source project for games built in Java! As part of this project, there will be a number of classes and interfaces with broad enough scope to create simple implementation into new Java games.

What's powerful about using a code base is really in the name, it is a base for everything you might need for your game. Whether it be calling sprites from a spritesheet, to easily creating animated objects without worrying about the full implementation of the classes, interfaces, and methods thereof. 

Additionally, this project is here to help drive home the four pillars of Object Orientated Programming: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Welcome again. We will be updating this ReadMe periodically with any updates and the dates of the changes.
